## Data:
- Drivers location
- Routes on map
  - might even pull google maps/API in while we're at it
- Student info, estimate pickup/destination time/distance
  - multiple students need to be supported
- Closest/onpath driver and license plate/car(uber-esque)

## UI Components
### Map
- just like google maps, a background for which other things will be overlayed on top of
- probably static in mockup, to be replaced with scrollable/moving aspect(or at least centers on vehicle)

### Vehicles
- some small vehicle icon, tagged with students and driver

### Menu
- select a child
- estimated arrival/departure time 
- small icon/related of logged in user
